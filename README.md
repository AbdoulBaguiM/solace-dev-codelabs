# Solace Codelabs
The purpose of these codelabs is to create easily consumable, step-by-step tutorials that walk a developer how to achieve a goal.  

This repository is included as a submodule in the main [site repo](https://github.com/SolaceDev/solace-dev-codelabs-site)

The site is deployed from that repo & codelab artifacts are kept here.
